1507,144,4,Rachel,"I mean, why not especially you and me?"
1506,144,3,Rachel,"What do you think Monica meant when she said she didn?t want to talk, especially with me?"
1505,144,2,Ross,"Hey, I just realized we kinda left some stuff up in the air"
1504,144,1,Rachel,"Hey."

1492,143,4,Chandler,"Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!"
1491,143,3,Monica,"Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!"
1490,143,2,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, who's this?"

1485,142,15,Rachel,"So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?"
1484,142,14,Rachel,"And it's not even for me!"
1483,142,13,Rachel,"Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee!"
1482,142,12,Rachel,"Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see."

1471,142,1,Monica,"We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing."
1470,142,0,Rachel,"Okay."
1469,141,18,Joey,"Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and...  no wait a minute... it was"

1467,141,16,Joey,"Oh!"
1466,141,15,Joey,"That's a tough one."
1465,141,14,Joey,"Uh!"
1464,141,13,Ross,"I can't! If he realizes that"
1463,141,12,Joey,"Well, just wake him up!"
1462,141,11,Ross,"In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder."
1461,141,10,Ross,"He's out cold!"
1460,141,9,Ross,"What am I supposed to do?"
1459,141,8,Joey,"Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!"

1457,141,6,Joey,"What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!"
1456,141,5,Ross,"It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!"
1455,141,4,Joey,"Oh! How's it going?"
1454,141,3,Ross,"I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker..."
1453,141,2,Joey,"No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?"
1452,141,1,Ross,"Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?"
1451,141,0,Joey,"Hello?"
1450,140,16,Phoebe,"No.  Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?"
1449,140,15,Supervisor,"So, I think you?re ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?"
1448,140,14,Phoebe,"Oh."
1447,140,13,Supervisor,"They?re always going to tell you they don?t need toner, but that?s okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script."
1446,140,12,Phoebe,"Oh well, all right?um, no offense, but you were kind of rude."
1445,140,11,Supervisor,"Okay, what was wrong with that call?"
1444,140,10,Phoebe,"Oh okay, well I?m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.  Yeah you?re right, this is easy."
1443,140,9,Supervisor,"We don?t need any toner."
1442,140,8,Chandler,"Wow that?s actually pretty cool."
1441,140,7,Ross,"In the biggest library in the university!"
1440,140,6,Ross,"Yeah, it?s right-it?s right down here!"
1439,140,5,Ross,"It?s here!"
1438,140,4,Ross,"My doctoral dissertation!"
1437,140,3,Ross,"Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y?know-y?know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up?"
1436,140,2,Chandler,"The hot chicks?"
1435,140,1,Ross,"Okay, okay take a guess."
1434,140,0,Chandler,"Come on! Why are we here?!"
1433,139,9,Woman,"Great!  Dad!  Thank you so much, I?ll be back to pick him up in an hour."
1432,139,8,Ross,"Yes I am."
1431,139,7,Woman,"Well, I don?t know. Are you a masseur?"
1430,139,6,Ross,"Can I, can I help you with something?"
1429,139,5,Woman,"Ohh great."
1428,139,4,Monica,"So, uh y?know, maybe this is selfish and I?m sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that."
1427,139,3,Monica,"See, I?ve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I?m only planning on doing this once."
1426,139,2,Rachel,"What?"
1425,139,1,Monica,"Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?"
1424,139,0,Ross,"Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw"
1423,138,12,Joey,"Yeah, that was real."
1422,138,11,Kate,"Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie."
1421,138,10,Jason,"W-w-w-wait! Why?!"
1420,138,9,Phoebe,"Well, we gotta get out of here!"
1419,138,8,Phoebe,"Oh my God, here they come!"
1418,138,7,Phoebe,"Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic."
1417,138,6,Jason,"No, no?"
1416,138,5,Phoebe,"No! No!"
1415,138,4,Jason,"Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!"
1414,138,3,Phoebe,"Oh my God!!!"
1413,138,2,Jason,"Whoa!"
1412,138,1,Phoebe,"That is so great! Oh, I...  Oh my God!"
1411,138,0,Jason,"...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life."
1410,137,10,Phoebe,"I don?t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him."
1409,137,9,Joey,"Oh-oh, what about Ross?"
1408,137,8,Phoebe,"We?ll have Chandler?s money and Rachel?s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel?s drinking problem."
1407,137,7,Phoebe,"But then we ditch those two and that?s when we get married."
1406,137,6,Joey,"Great!"
1405,137,5,Phoebe,"I know. Then, I?m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you?ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids."
1404,137,4,Joey,"Wow."
1403,137,3,Phoebe,"Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won?t work out."
1402,137,2,Joey,"Really?! Well, when?"
1401,137,1,Phoebe,"Oh we do, but not just yet."
1400,137,0,Joey,"So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?"
1399,136,12,Ross,"Me neither."
1398,136,11,Charlie,"I didn't do that."
1397,136,10,Ross,"And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?"
1396,136,9,Phoebe,"Ok, ok, how many of you"
1395,136,8,Monica,"Ok, quick    question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's    singing outside?"
1394,136,7,Monica,"Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm    Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. ..    Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever!"
1393,136,6,Phoebe,"Get your garlic-peelers    off me!"
1392,136,5,Monica,"Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!"
1391,136,4,Phoebe,"Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!"
1390,136,3,Monica,"Ok, you have to stop playing now."
1389,136,2,Phoebe,"You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is    not gonna overuse itself."
1388,136,1,Monica,"Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag    of cats against the wall."
1387,136,0,Phoebe,"Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here    at 'Javu' ...will kill you.."
1386,135,11,Phoebe,"I know I will."
1385,135,10,Phoebe,"Well it's just something to think about."
1384,135,9,Phoebe,"I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don?t even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee?Oh no, have I said to much?"
1383,135,8,Chandler,"What's going on?"
1382,135,7,Phoebe,"Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most."
1381,135,6,Chandler,"Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything."
1380,135,5,Phoebe,"Well, if you really wanna know, I'm?Oh! I can't tell you this."
1379,135,4,Kara,"I'm not all right."
1378,135,3,Doug,"Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger.  Are you all right sweethart?"
1377,135,2,Monica,"Game!"

1374,134,9,Joey,"No, no, no, don?t get up, I got a cooler right here."
1373,134,8,Chandler,"Yeah, I?ll go get one."
1372,134,7,Joey,"They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?"
1371,134,6,Chandler,"Wow! Look at them run."
1370,134,5,Joey,"Nicole Eggert. You'll like her."
1369,134,4,Chandler,"Well, it sounds kinda stupid...  Who?s she?"
1368,134,3,Joey,"Lifeguards."
1367,134,2,Chandler,"What?s it about?"
1366,134,1,Joey,"Baywatch."
1365,134,0,Chandler,"So ah, whatcha watching?"
1364,133,9,"Mr. Zelner","Last week when I asked you when your due date was uh, I certainly did not mean that I felt that"

1362,133,7,"Mr. Zelner","If I in any way implied that I wanted to buy your baby?I am sorry."
1361,133,6,Rachel,"Oh God."

1359,133,4,Rachel,"Yeah."
1358,133,3,"Mr. Zelner","Oh I think it?s best that I speak first."
1357,133,2,Rachel,"Okay look Mr. Zelner"
1356,133,1,"Mr. Zelner","Please, come in. Have a seat."
1355,133,0,Rachel,"Morning. You wanted to see me?"
1354,132,11,Joey,"Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in."
1353,132,10,Monica,"What kinda things have you been saying?"
1352,132,9,Joey,"You don?t fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they?ll start listening to all the nice things I?ve been saying about you."
1351,132,8,Joey,"Look, how-how about this?"
1350,132,7,Joey,"And I gotta pay rent!"
1349,132,6,Monica,"Joey, we had a deal. That-that?s why you?re here! I?ve got to fire you!"

1220,121,7,Monica,"Sure!"
1219,121,6,Chandler,"Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?"

1057,108,5,Phoebe,"God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would?ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself."
1056,108,4,Phoebe,"No, look, I told you that I didn?t want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway."
1055,108,3,Leslie,"I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts."
1054,108,2,Phoebe,"Okay, don?t give me a reason to get mad, okay"
1053,108,1,Leslie,"Come here, come here.  Okay, don?t get mad, okay."
1052,108,0,Phoebe,"Oh, I thought you weren?t coming. What? Where were you?"
1051,107,11,Chandler,"Oh dear God, what have I done!"
1050,107,10,Chandler,"The source of all my powers."
1049,107,9,Chandler,"Why didn?t I think of it?"
1048,107,8,Chandler,"That was an obvious joke, and I didn?t think of it."
1047,107,7,Monica,"Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!"
1046,107,6,Rachel,"What?!!"
1045,107,5,Monica,"Wow! It?s like Rachel in High School."
1044,107,4,Chandler,"Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting."
1043,107,3,Ross,"Is everything okay?"
1042,107,2,Chandler,"The doctor."
1041,107,1,Joey,"Where have you been?"
1040,107,0,Chandler,"Well hello!"
1039,106,11,Monica,"Oh, it was awful.  I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food."
1038,106,10,Joey,"Hey, how was your chef thing?"
1037,106,9,Monica,"Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?"
1036,106,8,Joey,"Hey, you're back too!"
1035,106,7,Monica,"Hi!"
1034,106,6,Chandler,"Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator."
1033,106,5,Joey,"Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?"
1032,106,4,Chandler,"It was terrible. I fought with  my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another"
1031,106,3,Joey,"How was your conference?"
1030,106,2,Chandler,"Hey."
1029,106,1,Joey,"Hey, you're back!"
1028,106,0,Chandler,Damn
1027,105,11,Rachel,"Okay."
1026,105,10,Rachel,"You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you?"
1025,105,9,Rachel,"Lemon Soother."
1024,105,8,Rachel,"We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.."
1023,105,7,Rachel,"Okay, okay, I checked."
1022,105,6,Rachel,"Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?"
1021,105,5,Monica,"But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do."
1020,105,4,Phoebe,"'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!"
1019,105,3,Rachel,"No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?"
1018,105,2,Monica,"Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night."
1017,105,1,Rachel,"Do what, do what?"
1016,105,0,Monica,"You can not do this."
1015,104,11,Joey,"You?re right! That did cheer me up!"
1014,104,10,Ross,"I?m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come."
1013,104,9,Joey,"What?"
1012,104,8,Ross,"Y?know what would cheer you up?"
1011,104,7,Joey,"Yeah! Yeah. I?ll be all right."
1010,104,6,Chandler,"You okay?"
1009,104,5,Joey,"Well, when it?s not right, you know it."
1008,104,4,Monica,"I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that."
1007,104,3,Joey,"Pretty much, yeah."
1006,104,2,Chandler,"Hey so, did uh, did she move out?"
1005,104,1,Joey,"How ya doin??"
1004,104,0,Ross,"Hey!"
1003,103,9,Ross,"Um... uh.... vulva."

999,103,5,Ross,"Ah...."
998,103,4,Celia,"Yes..."
997,103,3,Ross,"Wha... what, here?"
996,103,2,Celia,"No no no. Talk... dirty."
995,103,1,Ross,"OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning..."
994,103,0,Celia,"Talk to me."
993,102,13,Chandler,"Picking Rachel."
992,102,12,Monica,"Do you know what?s a bad idea?"
991,102,11,Chandler,"Yeah!"
990,102,10,Monica,"That?s a good idea."
989,102,9,Chandler,"And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes."
988,102,8,Chandler,"Y?know?"
987,102,7,Chandler,"I?m going to get a joke journal."
986,102,6,Chandler,"You know what?"
985,102,5,Chandler,"He stole my joke."
984,102,4,Chandler,"Ross, and you know what else Ross did?"
983,102,3,Chandler,"You know who else picked Rachel?"
982,102,2,Monica,"It?s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel."
981,102,1,Chandler,"He took my joke, he took it."
980,102,0,Monica,"She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel."
979,101,11,Tag,"Thank you."
978,101,10,Rachel,"You can go."
977,101,9,Tag,"Oh."
976,101,8,Rachel,"I?m having a baby."
975,101,7,Tag,"Come on Rach, let?s give it another try."
974,101,6,Rachel,Tag
973,101,5,Tag,"I?m ready for more."
972,101,4,Ross,"Oh. Oh, that?s right. So-so you did see me that day, because it seemed like you didn?t."
971,101,3,Cassie,"It?s been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see"
970,101,2,Ross,"Hey!"
969,101,1,Cassie,"Hey Ross!"
968,101,0,Ross,"Cassie?!"
967,100,13,Phoebe,"Really?!"
966,100,12,Melissa,"Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you?re talking about."
965,100,11,Rachel,"we went back to the house and we got really silly and we?we made out."
964,100,10,Melissa,"Yeah?"
963,100,9,Rachel,"Remember?! We?come on, we both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops"
962,100,8,Melissa,"What?"
961,100,7,Rachel,"I was uh, tellin? Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out."
960,100,6,Rachel,"Anyway, speaking of drinking too much."
959,100,5,Melissa,"Oh, isn?t a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?"
958,100,4,Phoebe,"Yeah! Y?know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning."
957,100,3,Melissa,"What one?"
956,100,2,Phoebe,"Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon."
955,100,1,Melissa,"Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?"
954,100,0,Richard,"Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?"
953,99,13,Chandler,"Oh my God!!"
952,99,12,Joey,"Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There?s a lot of theories that didn?t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry."
951,99,11,Chandler,"That?s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat."
950,99,10,Ross,"That?s all you?re basing this on?"
949,99,9,Chandler,"She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!"
948,99,8,Joey,"Dude, tell me she actually told you this."
947,99,7,Chandler,"Well y'know, what if she didn?t actually sleep with the guy?"
946,99,6,Ross,"How might you be wrong?"
945,99,5,Chandler,"Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?"
944,99,4,Ross,"He?s right, what she did was unforgivable."
943,99,3,Joey,"No! Forget her, man! You don?t need her, you don?t need that!"
942,99,2,Chandler,"All right, maybe I should call her."
941,99,1,Phoebe,"No, sorry."
940,99,0,Chandler,"Did she call?"
939,98,11,Ross,"Imagine his consternation when? Oh bloody hell."
938,98,10,Ross,"What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary."
937,98,9,Ross,"So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery!"
936,98,8,Ross,"Right!"
935,98,7,Rachel,"Wow, we really are bitches."
934,98,6,Rachel,"Hey sisters!"
933,98,5,Rachel,"I was a Kappa."
932,98,4,Rachel,"There?s some Kappa Kappa Deltas!"
931,98,3,Rachel,"Oh hey look!"
930,98,2,Rachel,"Yeah, we could."
929,98,1,Monica,"Yeah, but y?know we could sneak in and watch."
928,98,0,Rachel,"Well, we?re a little early, the lecture doesn?t end for 15 minutes."
927,97,10,Chandler,"BEND OVER?!!!"
926,97,9,Joey,"I was tryin? to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I?m gonna do?"
925,97,8,Chandler,"So?You got in"
924,97,7,Joey,"Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn?t think big enough to fit a grown man!"
923,97,6,Chandler,"What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!"
922,97,5,Joey,"Awww, man! He promised he wouldn?t take the chairs!!"
921,97,4,Chandler,"What happened?!!"
920,97,3,Joey,"Yeah..."
919,97,2,Chandler,"Are you all right?!"
918,97,1,Joey,"WHAT?!!"
917,97,0,Chandler,"OH MY GOD!!!"
916,96,13,Phoebe,"Love it!"
915,96,12,Monica,"I paid to have this done."
914,96,11,Phoebe,"That?s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too."
913,96,10,Monica,"All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!"
912,96,9,Phoebe,"But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?"
911,96,8,Monica,"Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished."
910,96,7,Phoebe,"And besides I?ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two."
909,96,6,Phoebe,"Well maybe he was just nervous, y?know you can be very intimidating."
908,96,5,Monica,"Because he?s terrible! Okay, he?s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!"
907,96,4,Phoebe,"But why?!"
906,96,3,Monica,"I?I have to fire him."
905,96,2,Phoebe,"Oh my God! I had the"
904,96,1,Monica,"Hi!"
903,96,0,Phoebe,"Ooh Monica!"
902,95,11,Chandler,"Yeah!"
901,95,10,Monica,"Chandler?"
900,95,9,Chandler,"Look down , look down, look down"
899,95,8,Chandler,"Okay, see?"
898,95,7,Chandler,"I don?t know, but don?t worry, don?t worry, because I know how to take a picture now."
897,95,6,Monica,"Chandler, what were you thinking?"
896,95,5,Chandler,"Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!"
895,95,4,Monica,"What?!"
894,95,3,Chandler,"Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine."
893,95,2,Monica,"Are you okay?"
892,95,1,Chandler,"There I am!"
891,95,0,Monica,"Hey! There you are!"
890,94,9,Phoebe,"Not if I get there first."
889,94,8,Joey,"Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?"
888,94,7,Phoebe,"Six months."
887,94,6,Joey,"Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?"
886,94,5,Phoebe,"Okay."
885,94,4,Joey,"Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that?s much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?"
884,94,3,Phoebe,"Hm-mm, corn beef."
883,94,2,Joey,"Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y?know what goes good with that?"
882,94,1,Phoebe,"Pastrami."
881,94,0,Joey,"Oooh, what you got there?"
880,93,11,Ross,"I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life."
879,93,10,Ross,"No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's"
878,93,9,Rachel,"What?"
877,93,8,Rachel,"What?"
876,93,7,Rachel,"Did you just picture it differently?"
875,93,6,Rachel,"What?"
874,93,5,Rachel,"Did I get the hair wrong?"
873,93,4,Rachel,"Did I get it wrong?"
872,93,3,Rachel,"Honey, what is it?"
871,93,2,Rachel,"What?"
870,93,1,Rachel,"I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face."
869,93,0,Rachel,"Okay, here we go."
868,92,9,Richard,"Exactly."
867,92,8,Monica,"?Cause if you do that means you?d be cancelling it for me, and we?re just friends."
866,92,7,Richard,"Okay."
865,92,6,Monica,"No!  No!"
864,92,5,Richard,"You want me to cancel it?"
863,92,4,Monica,"Oh."
862,92,3,Richard,"Just your dad.  Although that?s actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister?s neighbour next Tuesday."
861,92,2,Monica,"Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?"
860,92,1,Richard,"Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball."
859,92,0,Monica,"So we can be friends who sleep together."
858,91,11,Ross,"You're right!"
857,91,10,Rachel,"I bet 20."
856,91,9,Ross,"Oohh, 23.  Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!"
855,91,8,Rachel,"Hit me!"
854,91,7,Ross,13
853,91,6,Ross,"Here we go."
852,91,5,Ross,"All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack."
851,91,4,Ross,"We can bring Vegas up to us!"
850,91,3,Ross,"We don?t have to go downstairs!"
849,91,2,Ross,"Y'know what?"
848,91,1,Ross,"All right."
847,91,0,Rachel,"Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel."
846,90,11,Phoebe,"Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!"
845,90,10,Ross,"Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?"
844,90,9,Monica,"Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner."

840,90,5,Monica,"Whatever you decide, whatever you do."
839,90,4,Joey,"Look, we were"
838,90,3,Phoebe,"You're kinda stepping on the song."
837,90,2,Chandler,"Yeah, we are so sorry."
836,90,1,Joey,"Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk."
835,90,0,Ross,"Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood."
834,89,10,Rachel,"Yeah! Yeah. They?re?they?re-they?re my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus."
833,89,9,"The Rabbi","I don?t know. Are they Greek Orthodox?"

811,87,9,Rachel,"Okay? You ready?"
810,87,8,Joey,"That?s true."
809,87,7,Rachel,"But don?t you think Rosita would?ve wanted you to move on? I mean y?know, she did always put?your comfort first."
808,87,6,Joey,"She?s not even cold yet!"

791,85,10,Phoebe,"Shut it down."
790,85,9,Larry,"This does."
789,85,8,Phoebe,"You have the power to do that?"
788,85,7,Larry,"Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!"
787,85,6,Phoebe,"Why?!"
786,85,5,Larry,"We're outta here!"
785,85,4,Phoebe,"You are just nonstop!"

765,83,11,Ross,"No."
764,83,10,Chandler,"Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last."
763,83,9,Ross,"But I should warn you, I am"
762,83,8,Ross,"Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I?d be glad to play you for it."

753,82,10,Phoebe,"This is fashion?!  Okay, so to you,"
752,82,9,Rachel,"Not nature,"
751,82,8,Rachel,"Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature!"
750,82,7,Rachel,"What?"
749,82,6,Monica,"Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated."
748,82,5,Rachel,"Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!"
747,82,4,Phoebe,"He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies."
746,82,3,Monica,"Crematorium Chris? Sure!"
745,82,2,Phoebe,"So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?"
744,82,1,Monica,"Hey!"
743,82,0,Phoebe,"Hey!"
742,81,10,Carol,"Not her."
741,81,9,Carol,"All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set."
740,81,8,Rachel,"There. Now there is."
739,81,7,Joey,"Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!"
738,81,6,Rachel,"Okay, here we go..."
737,81,5,Chandler,"I happen to know a Fun Bob."
736,81,4,Joey,"You know more than one Fun Bobby?"
735,81,3,Monica,"Yeah."
734,81,2,Chandler,"Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?"
733,81,1,Monica,"I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby."
732,81,0,Ross,"So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?"
731,80,13,Phoebe,"I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better."
730,80,12,Rachel,"It's Le Poo."
729,80,11,Monica,"Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry."
728,80,10,Rachel,"Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh.  Oh my God."
727,80,9,Ross,"Le Poo's still alive?!"
726,80,8,Rachel,"Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!"
725,80,7,Ross,"What?!"
724,80,6,Rachel,"Oh my God! My dog died!"
723,80,5,Ross,"Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily"
722,80,4,Chandler,"And condoms are the way to do that?"
721,80,3,Joey,"You don't know how long we're gonna be in here!"
720,80,2,Chandler,"Condoms?"
719,80,1,Phoebe,"Ooh,"
718,80,0,Monica,"Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles"
717,79,10,Joey,"Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?"
716,79,9,Chandler,"Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors."
715,79,8,Ross,"Sorry! Sorry! Oh,  there!  Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!"
714,79,7,Gary,"Ross!"
713,79,6,Ross,"Yeah, no problem."
712,79,5,Gary,"Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here."
711,79,4,Ross,"Umm, jealous!"
710,79,3,Chandler,"Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay."
709,79,2,"Casting Director #1","Hold it. I?m sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less?intense?"
708,79,1,Joey,"Okay. """"Hey, Timmy, I?ve got a surprise for you."""""
707,79,0,"Casting Director #1","Whenever you?re ready."
706,78,12,Rachel,"No, just singing."
705,78,11,Ross,"Did you say something?"
704,78,10,Rachel,"Hang in there. You hang in there."
703,78,9,Ross,"Yeah, all right, it?s a date."
702,78,8,Rachel,"That would be great!"
701,78,7,Ross,"Say, Sunday night?"
700,78,6,Ross,"Uh, in fact Emily?s coming into town this weekend, why don?t you say we all have dinner?"
699,78,5,Ross,"If like the four of us could all y?know, hang out together."
698,78,4,Rachel,"Oh yeah, no, what?s that?"
697,78,3,Ross,"Hey, y?know, y?know what would make me really happy?"
696,78,2,Rachel,"Oh yeah? Fine."
695,78,1,Rachel,"Um-hmm.  There we go. There it is."
694,78,0,Joshua,"So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?"
693,77,13,Chandler,"Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you?re not married to anymore of us are ya?"
692,77,12,Phoebe,"Another lie. You have a sickness!"
691,77,11,Ross,"Phoebe, I told her you already knew."
690,77,10,Phoebe,"Okay,"
689,77,9,Ross,"Rach, come on, if you think about it, it?s actually kinda funny.  Okay, maybe it?s best not to think about it."
688,77,8,Chandler,"Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?"
687,77,7,Ross,"Okay, maybe it wasn?t my best decision. But I just couldn?t face another failed marriage."
686,77,6,Monica,"Ross!"
685,77,5,Phoebe,"Oh my God!!"
684,77,4,Monica,"You?re kidding!"
683,77,3,Chandler,"What?"
682,77,2,Rachel,"When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didn?t get the annulment; we are still married."
681,77,1,Ross,"Look I was going to tell you!"
680,77,0,Rachel,"I cannot believe that you didn?t tell me that we are still married!!"
679,76,13,Chandler,"Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla."
678,76,12,Joey,"See this is what I was afraid of, I didn占쏙옙t think I should be  here either but somebody  said he占쏙옙d be over it by now."
677,76,11,Rachel,"Yeah, I占쏙옙m not so sure you should be here when he comes up."
676,76,10,Joey,"That占쏙옙s not fair! I can占쏙옙t do that."
675,76,9,Rachel,"Well, you more then me, but he can占쏙옙t stay to mad at me. I  mean, I just had his baby."
674,76,8,Joey,"Is he still mad at us?"
673,76,7,Rachel,"He占쏙옙s downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the  cab."
672,76,6,Joey,"Hey so where占쏙옙s Ross?"
671,76,5,Rachel,"What are people think占쏙옙  Oh you guys I love it."

669,76,3,Rachel,"Oh Ah!"
668,76,2,Phoebe,"Look at all the stuff people sent!"
667,76,1,Rachel,"Oh you guys thanks for doing this."
666,76,0,Monica,"Phoebe did the signs!"
665,75,9,Chandler,"Actually, it?s Miss Chinandolor Bong."
664,75,8,Monica,"I knew that! Rachel! Use you?re head!"
663,75,7,Ross,"I?m afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong."
662,75,6,Monica,"No!!"
661,75,5,Rachel,"Chandler gets it! It?s Chandler Bing!"
660,75,4,Ross,"Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey?s apartment. What name appears on the address label?"
659,75,3,Rachel,"We?ll take Literature!!"
658,75,2,Chandler,"Nice shooting!"
657,75,1,Ross,"Althea is correct."
656,75,0,Chandler,"You're shooting with Althea?!"
655,74,9,Joey,"Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually."
654,74,8,Bob,"Monica, Monica is great."
653,74,7,Joey,"Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it."
652,74,6,Bob,"Huh, I never really noticed."
651,74,5,Joey,"Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel."
650,74,4,Joey,"That cute nibbly noise when she eats."
649,74,3,Joey,"You know what I miss the most about her?"
648,74,2,Joey,"You're a lucky man."
647,74,1,All,"Hey!"
646,74,0,Ross,"Look at it this way:"
645,73,13,Chandler,"That?s correct."
644,73,12,Monica,"The second sister dies in"
643,73,11,Chandler,"No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading."
642,73,10,Monica,"The second sister dies?!"
641,73,9,Chandler,"Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?"
640,73,8,Monica,"Okay that does sound like fun."
639,73,7,Chandler,"It?d be fun!"
638,73,6,Chandler,"We can just like talk to each other all night long, y?know like we did when we were first going out."
637,73,5,Chandler,"Y?know, now that we are up?"
636,73,4,Chandler,"Hey, y?know what we can do?"
635,73,3,Monica,"Here, let me make the milk, I?m up anyway."
634,73,2,Chandler,"It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!"
633,73,1,Monica,"With a wok?  I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep."
632,73,0,Chandler,"Shhhhhhhhh!!!  I?m sorry, I thought maybe I?d make some warm milk and it would help me sleep."
631,72,10,Monica,"No, she's out shopping."
630,72,9,Ross,"Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her."
629,72,8,Monica,"Hey."
628,72,7,Joey,"Hey!"
627,72,6,Ross,"Hey."
626,72,5,Chandler,"It's a real conference."
625,72,4,Chandler,"Do you want people to think it's a fake conference?"
624,72,3,Chandler,"I'm not in charge of where the conference is held."
623,72,2,Monica,"Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont."
622,72,1,Phoebe,"Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!"
621,72,0,Monica,"Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey."
620,71,10,Monica,"Yeah, I knew."
619,71,9,Phoebe,"Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?"
618,71,8,Monica,"Hey! I didn't know either."
617,71,7,Phoebe,"I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart."
616,71,6,Monica,"That's not gonna work."
615,71,5,Phoebe,"You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know."
614,71,4,Monica,"Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica!  Oooh, I can't leave her!"
613,71,3,Phoebe,"Yeah, okay."
612,71,2,Monica,"Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong."
611,71,1,Phoebe,"Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely."
610,71,0,Monica,"Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now."
609,70,11,Chandler,"If I broke up with you, I?d miss you."
608,70,10,Ross,"Then be supportive like a guy."
607,70,9,Chandler,"It?s possible. You are very loveable, I?d miss you if I broke up with you.  I was just trying to be supportive."
606,70,8,Ross,"Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks."
605,70,7,Joey,"Wow, what-what do you think she wants?"
604,70,6,Ross,"So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute."
603,70,5,"Chandler and Joey","Hey!"
602,70,4,Ross,"Hello."
601,70,3,Joey,"Okay, and whenever I can?t do it, they?re all like-like laughing at me."
600,70,2,Joey,"She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks."
599,70,1,Joey,"I hate her!"
598,70,0,Joey,"I hate this woman!!"
597,69,10,Chandler,"Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!"
596,69,9,Monica,"OH!"
595,69,8,Chandler,"Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than    on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!"
594,69,7,Monica,"Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think    it's a good idea!"
593,69,6,Chandler,"I cannot believe Ross told you that!     And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!"
592,69,5,Monica,"It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do    it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?"
591,69,4,Chandler,"It's weird! In a doctor's office?"
590,69,3,Monica,"What is the big deal?"
589,69,2,Monica,"Which?"
588,69,1,Joey,"Yep."
587,69,0,Monica,"Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?"
586,68,9,Monica,"Are you kidding?! I get a"
585,68,8,Rachel,"Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it."
584,68,7,Monica,"Do you guys know what happened to Chandler?s barcalounger?"
583,68,6,Joey,"Hey!"
582,68,5,Rachel,"Hey!"
581,68,4,Monica,"Hey guys!"
580,68,3,Rachel,"Uh-huh."
579,68,2,Joey,"Ahhh??  Eh?"
578,68,1,Rachel,"Ahhhh?."
577,68,0,Joey,"Oh yeah."
576,67,10,Monica,"Oh my God! Chandler!"
575,67,9,Phoebe,"Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where"
574,67,8,Monica,"Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all    this? I can barely control myself."
573,67,7,Phoebe,"Hey!"
572,67,6,Monica,"Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered."
571,67,5,Joey,"you have to calm down, alright...    go, go get yourself a drink or something..."
570,67,4,Joey,"Hey, that's why I didn't invite you."
569,67,3,Monica,"I love you!"
568,67,2,"Kyle Lowder","Hi."
567,67,1,Monica,"Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!"
566,67,0,Joey,"Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it     Thanks for coming."
565,66,9,Joey,"I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadn?t and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and?  I haven?t bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?"
564,66,8,Joey,"I mean seriously, she?s like the perfect woman."
563,66,7,Phoebe,"I know!"
562,66,6,Joey,"God. He?s crazy! Why doesn?t he want to be with Rachel?"
561,66,5,Phoebe,"Right. And with who again?"
560,66,4,Ross,"Okay, stop it! I can?t deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby."
559,66,3,Phoebe,"But y?know what? It just seems that you two belong together."
558,66,2,Ross,"Are you kidding? Look, we?re not gonna be together just because we?re having a baby. Okay?"
557,66,1,Phoebe,"Yeah.  Why aren?t you with Rachel?"
556,66,0,Ross,"she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I?m not with Rachel."
555,65,11,Ross,"Oh, I?m sorry you?ve been Bamboozled! You?re gonna be a terrible mother!  I?ve lost sight of why we?re doing this!"
554,65,10,Rachel,"A card! A card! I pick a card!"
553,65,9,Ross,"Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?"
552,65,8,Rachel,"Check if it?s wet, check if it?s hungry, burp it!"
551,65,7,Ross,"That?s correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?"
550,65,6,Rachel,"Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers."
549,65,5,Ross,"Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?"
548,65,4,Rachel,"Uh, put your elbow in it."
547,65,3,Ross,"All right then.  Rachel Green! Let?s play Bamboozled!  How do you test the temperature of the baby?s bath water?"
546,65,2,Rachel,"Yes, I?ve done my studying and I really know my stuff."
545,65,1,Ross,"You sure?"
544,65,0,Rachel,"Okay! I?m ready."
543,64,9,Monica,"Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?"
542,64,8,Monica,"I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change."
541,64,7,Monica,"No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them!"
540,64,6,Chandler,"Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!"
539,64,5,Monica,"We're switching rooms."
538,64,4,Chandler,"Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!"
537,64,3,Monica,"Come here.  Okay, be right back."
536,64,2,Chandler,"Oh, you should live with Joey,"
535,64,1,Monica,"Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!"
534,64,0,Chandler,"I can't believe it! We're here!"
533,63,9,Joey,"Come on."
532,63,8,Joey,"Okay, moving right along."
531,63,7,Joey,"Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work."
530,63,6,Joey,"Everyone wave ?Hi? to Ross."
529,63,5,Joey,"Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller."
528,63,4,Joey,"Right down here,  we have a large foot."
527,63,3,Joey,"This is a museum, no talking."
526,63,2,Joey,"Shhh!"
525,63,1,"Smart Kid","Isn?t the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?"
524,63,0,Joey,"Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period."
523,62,12,Rachel,"Yeah, I do."
522,62,11,Monica,"I don?t remember. Do you wanna take a walk?"
521,62,10,Rachel,"Oh yeah, what?s it about?"
520,62,9,Monica,"I am good. I finished my book."
519,62,8,Rachel,"So, how are you?"
518,62,7,Monica,"Oh my God!"
517,62,6,Rachel,"Music. Very nice."
516,62,5,Monica,"I guess they?re back from their date."
515,62,4,Rachel,"Oh.  Oh my God, is that Phoebe?"
514,62,3,Monica,"No honey, I?m sorry, but the weekend?s not over yet."
513,62,2,Chandler,"Yes, this, this was pleasant."
512,62,1,Joanna,"Well, thanks again for lunch."
511,62,0,Chandler,"It?s not a big deal. It?s, just it?s right here,  and it?s all the time."
510,61,12,Chandler,"Okay, let?s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently."
509,61,11,Joey,"Okay, you?re on."
508,61,10,Chandler,"Yes it would. What do you say to $50?"
507,61,9,Joey,"It would be easier if you just give me your money."
506,61,8,Joey,"You haven?t beaten me once since my injury plagued ?97 season."
505,61,7,Joey,"What, are you crazy?"
504,61,6,Chandler,"What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?"
503,61,5,Chandler,"Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night."
502,61,4,Joey,"Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!"
501,61,3,Joey,"Hey, actually in a way it?s kinda nice."
500,61,2,Joey,"Oh that?s okay."
499,61,1,Chandler,"Oh, I wish I?d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese."
498,61,0,Joey,"Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates."
497,60,13,Phoebe,"Nah-ha!"
496,60,12,Ross,"Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?"
495,60,11,Ross,"I ate hot fudge off you naked."
494,60,10,Ross,"Rachel, I?ve seen you naked a million times."
493,60,9,Rachel,"I don?t want you to see me naked!"
492,60,8,Ross,"What?"
491,60,7,Rachel,"Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around."
490,60,6,Ross,"Sure, okay."
489,60,5,Rachel,"Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?"
488,60,4,Ross,"Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?"
487,60,3,Rachel,"Sure, I?ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing."
486,60,2,Ross,"Yep?"
485,60,1,Rachel,"Sure."
484,60,0,Ross,"There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?"
483,59,10,Monica,"But the minute we start to lie to each other?  And by 'we' I mean society."
482,59,9,Ross,"Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings."
481,59,8,Monica,"You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that."
480,59,7,Chandler,"I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!"
479,59,6,Rachel,"Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish."
478,59,5,Phoebe,"That old jackass!"
477,59,4,Phoebe,"Then I felt wonderful."
476,59,3,Phoebe,"But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies."
475,59,2,Phoebe,"Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop."
474,59,1,Phoebe,"Y'know that old guy that lives next to me?"
473,59,0,Phoebe,"I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed!"
472,58,11,"Fake Monica","Really? Then why are you like that?"
471,58,10,Monica,"Um, I'm not actually Amish."
470,58,9,"Fake Monica","Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing."
469,58,8,Monica,"Not necessarily..."
468,58,7,"Fake Monica","You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are."
467,58,6,"Fake Monica","There's nothing to wonder about, Monica."
466,58,5,Monica,"Well, not... worried, just... wondering."
465,58,4,"Fake Monica","Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the"
464,58,3,Ross,"Thank you!"
463,58,2,Carol,"Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller."
462,58,1,Ross,"Helen Geller? I don't think so."
461,58,0,Susan,"Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?"
460,57,13,Everyone,"Hi, welcome home!"
459,57,12,Rachel,"Hi!"
458,57,11,Joey,"You know what you should占쏙옙ve done, you should have told yourself  that little story."
457,57,10,Chandler,"Not matter what I did I couldn占쏙옙t fall asleep."
456,57,9,Chandler,"I was like, if I fall asleep  now I占쏙옙ll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I占쏙옙ll get five hours  sleep."
455,57,8,Chandler,"Y占쏙옙know?"
454,57,7,Chandler,"Couldn占쏙옙t sleep last night you know, then I started worrying  about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried  about it the more I couldn占쏙옙t sleep."
453,57,6,Joey,"Why占쏙옙re you so tired?"

445,56,8,Rachel,"Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!"
444,56,7,Ross,"Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!"
443,56,6,Ross,"Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'?"
442,56,5,Rachel,"Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist..."
441,56,4,Joey,"You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'."
440,56,3,Monica,"What's a 'niffle'?"
439,56,2,Monica,"Bye... bye..."
438,56,1,Rachel,"Oh, time's up."
437,56,0,Chandler,Airplane
436,55,13,Joey,"Listen, I ah, I know it?s a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?"
435,55,12,Chandler,"It came up."
434,55,11,Joey,"Heard about the leg burnin? huh?"
433,55,10,Chandler,"Actually he?s the smallest person in the world."
432,55,9,Joey,"Morning."
431,55,8,Joey,"She?s right in there."
430,55,7,Chandler,"Where?s Mary-Angela?"
429,55,6,Joey,"Yeah."
428,55,5,Joey,"She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body."
427,55,4,Joey,"Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, ?cause my Grandma doesn?t know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off."
426,55,3,Joey,"You are so the man!"
425,55,2,Chandler,"I?m here to see Mary-Angela."
424,55,1,Joey,"Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?"
423,55,0,Chandler,"Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?"
422,54,10,Rachel,"Ok. That's fine."
421,54,9,"Dr. Franzblau","I'm gonna go check up on your friend."
420,54,8,Rachel,"Yeah. Gotcha."
419,54,7,"Dr. Franzblau","Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'..."
418,54,6,Rachel,"I'm a waitress."
417,54,5,Ross,"Sorry."
416,54,4,Ross,"Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we-  Sorry."
415,54,3,Ross,"Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know."
414,54,2,Chandler,"We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes."
413,54,1,Joey,"Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!"
412,54,0,Chandler,"...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!"
411,53,13,Joey,"Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!"
410,53,12,Chandler,"If you were in a school yard you?d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!"
409,53,11,Chandler,"Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours!"
408,53,10,Joey,"Oh.  Ohh. Ohh, you?re out of your mind."
407,53,9,Chandler,"I?m talking about you. You big, big freak."
406,53,8,Joey,"Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?"
405,53,7,Chandler,"I think somebody has a crush on somebody."
404,53,6,Joey,"With her, ?Oh, I?m so talented.? and ?Oh, I?m so pretty,? and ?Ooh, I smell so good.?"
403,53,5,Joey,"I hate her!!"
402,53,4,Joey,"God, I just, I hate her!"
401,53,3,Chandler,"Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth."
400,53,2,Joey,"Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she?s like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!"
399,53,1,Chandler,"I wasn?t doing anything.  Uh-oh, what did she do now?"
398,53,0,Chandler,"I don?t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.  Draw!!"
397,52,11,Phoebe,"Okay, so it?s probably just the Ross thing then."
396,52,10,Rachel,"I don?t have any issues with my Father."
395,52,9,Phoebe,"Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you?re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father."
394,52,8,Rachel,"Y'know, like I?d be cheating on Ross or something."
393,52,7,Rachel,"I mean I?m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who?s asking me to go out with him, which I?m allowed to do, and I felt guilty."
392,52,6,Rachel,"Oh, but it was so strange."
391,52,5,Rachel,"I mean I think I?d say no to anybody right now."
390,52,4,Phoebe,"Huh."
389,52,3,Rachel,"Well, I told him I would think about it, but I?m gonna tell him no."
388,52,2,Phoebe,"What, so what are you gonna tell him?"
387,52,1,Rachel,"I know."
386,52,0,Phoebe,"Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out."
385,51,11,Joey,"Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna    be, but...  I made it work."
384,51,10,Ross,"Glad I could help man."
383,51,9,Joey,"Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me    up."
382,51,8,Charlie,"Yeah, let's go.   Thanks    Ross."
381,51,7,Joey,"You're ready?"
380,51,6,Charlie,"Hey!"
379,51,5,Ross,"Hey!"
378,51,4,Joey,"Hey!"
377,51,3,Ross,"That was going to be my next argument."
376,51,2,Charlie,"He is very sweet. Plus he's"
375,51,1,Ross,"You know, that's the    kind of guy Joey is."
374,51,0,Ross,"And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all    that stuff is because he thought it was important to you."
373,50,11,Rachel,"Well, actually Gunther sent me. You?re not allowed to have cups out here, it?s a thing."
372,50,10,Phoebe,"You?re so sweet to wait with me."
371,50,9,Phoebe,"It?s like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing."
370,50,8,Phoebe,"Y'know it?s just y'know Mom?s dead, don?t talk to my sister, Grandma?s been sleeping a lot lately."
369,50,7,Phoebe,"No, I know, I?m just nervous."
368,50,6,Rachel,"Well relax, he?ll be here."
367,50,5,Phoebe,"Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, ?Frank?s always late.?"
366,50,4,Rachel,"I thought you only met him once?"
365,50,3,Phoebe,"No, but he?s always late."
364,50,2,Rachel,"Any sign of your brother?"
363,50,1,Phoebe,"Hey!"
362,50,0,Rachel,"Hey Pheebs."
361,49,8,Ross,"Oh! So-so seriously, what time?"
360,49,7,Ross,"Gotcha."
359,49,6,Ross,"What time?"
358,49,5,Ross,"Oh I, I don?t-I don?t think that would be the best idea."
357,49,4,Ross,"That was you?"
356,49,3,Erin,"What about shut up?"
355,49,2,Joey,"What about Game 1 of the Series?"
354,49,1,Erin,"What about Benitez?"
353,49,0,Joey,"How can you say that?! The"
352,48,6,Ross,"Look, it's just a little more complicated..."
351,48,5,Joey,"You slept with her for seven years after that."
350,48,4,Joey,"So you slept with her for the first time, so what?"
349,48,3,Joey,"What is the big deal about today?"
348,48,2,Joey,"He's right, enough, already."
347,48,1,Chandler,"Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?"
346,48,0,Ross,"I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow."
345,47,8,Mona,"Ohh!  And I love spending time with you."
344,47,7,Ross,"I love you!"
343,47,6,Mona,"What?"
342,47,5,Ross,"I?m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape."
341,47,4,Mona,"Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you?re-you?re sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?"
340,47,3,Mona,"I don?t understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and then you change the lock."
339,47,2,Ross,"No. That guy is."
338,47,1,Mona,"Hey Ross, what?s going on? You changing the lock?"
337,47,0,Ross,"Okay, and oh I?m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all."
336,46,6,Ross,"Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?"
335,46,5,Joey,"Right.? Thanks.? It's June.? I'm outta here."
334,46,4,Chandler,"Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats."
333,46,3,Joey,"Great story!? But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...? Oh man,"
332,46,2,Ross,"Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?"
331,46,1,Ross,"Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon?"
330,46,0,Ross,"Grab a spoon."
329,45,5,Chandler,"I... I don't know... you seem lovely."
328,45,4,"Bitter lady","Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word."
327,45,3,"Bitter lady","Because in    life there are no intermissions, people."
326,45,2,"Bitter lady","Well, you're not gonna get one!"
325,45,1,Chandler,"oh yes, God yes!!"
324,45,0,"Bitter lady","Well, I bet you are all thinkin' """"Now would be a really    great time for an intermission"""", huh?"
323,44,6,Chandler,"Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?"
322,44,5,Rachel,"I know, me neither! I mean, you"
321,44,4,Ross,"I can't believe that didn't work!"
320,44,3,Chandler,"Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now."
319,44,2,Ross,"All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again."
318,44,1,Rachel,"You think?!"
317,44,0,Ross,"Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore."
316,43,4,"Joey's Doctor","Kidney stones!"
315,43,3,Joey,"Or?"
314,43,2,"Joey's Doctor","It's kidney stones."
313,43,1,Joey,"Umm, well, what else could it be?"
312,43,0,"Joey's Doctor","Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones."
311,42,8,Joey,"Noo!! I?ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!"
310,42,7,Chandler,"Yeah?"
309,42,6,Joey,"Me too."
308,42,5,Chandler,"And if it makes you feel any better, I?ve had a really lousy day."
307,42,4,Chandler,"I really shouldn?t have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn?t cool."
306,42,3,Chandler,"No-no-no, y?know what?"
305,42,2,Joey,"Oh.  Sorry!"
304,42,1,Chandler,"Hey."
303,42,0,Joey,"Hey."
302,41,8,"Dr. Franzblau","It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?"
301,41,7,"Dr. Franzblau","I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do."
300,41,6,Rachel,"Oh."
299,41,5,"Dr. Franzblau","No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do."
298,41,4,Rachel,"Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors."
297,41,3,"Dr. Franzblau","No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me."
296,41,2,Rachel,"No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?"
295,41,1,"Dr. Franzblau","So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?"
294,41,0,"Dr. Franzblau","I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great."

275,38,3,Chandler,"Oh, how well you know me..."
274,38,2,Rachel,"You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!"
273,38,1,Chandler,"And yet you're surprisingly upbeat."
272,38,0,Rachel,"Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today."
271,37,6,Ross,"I know, I wasn?t finished.   But don?t worry! We?re gonna go down the fire escape!!"
270,37,5,Joey,"Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape."

268,37,3,Joey,"All right well, y?know?I guess we know what we have to do to get down."
267,37,2,Ross,"I can?t believe this!!"

239,32,6,Doug,"Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, y?know I did it and I felt a hell of a lot better and if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head."
238,32,5,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no!"
237,32,4,Doug,"No, it?s a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We?re gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!"
236,32,3,Chandler,"It?s a hand. It?s a thing you use as a"
235,32,2,Doug,"Bing?What?s this?!"
234,32,1,Chandler,"Oh that?s all right sir, and that?s just one girl."
233,32,0,Doug,"Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. Huh?"
232,31,6,Frank,"Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be."
231,31,5,Phoebe,"She wasn?t a hooker."
230,31,4,Frank,"Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker..."
229,31,3,Phoebe,"Uh-huh."
228,31,2,Frank,"This?"

216,29,2,Bob,"I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but I just found out its not gonna happen."
215,29,1,Chandler,"Sure, what?s up?"
214,29,0,Bob,"Hey Toby, you got a sec?"
213,28,5,Monica,"Because I think it might take some of the heat off me."
212,28,4,Monica,"I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing?"
211,28,3,"Mrs. Geller","Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy."
210,28,2,Monica,"How was that possible?"
209,28,1,"Young Ethan","I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen."
208,28,0,Monica,"Did not."
207,27,8,Phoebe,"Well let?s just say its.. she?s lucky she has a sweet ass, ?cause she?s not so good at the writing."
206,27,7,Ross,"How?s Monica coming along with her vows?"
205,27,6,Joey,"How is """"Monica, I love your sweet ass,"""" inappropriate?"""""
204,27,5,Ross,"Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions."
203,27,4,Rachel,"Hey, what have you guys been up to?"
202,27,3,Phoebe,"Hey!"
201,27,2,Rachel,"Hey!"
200,27,1,Ross,"Hey!"
199,27,0,Joey,"Hey!"
198,26,6,Joey,"Yeah, okay."
197,26,5,"Casting Director #2","No."
196,26,4,Joey,"Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah,"
195,26,3,"Casting Director #2","No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag."
194,26,2,Joey,"Exactly."
193,26,1,"Casting Director #2","That?s where you pick up the bag."
192,26,0,Joey,"So that?s why I feed my dog"
191,25,6,Phoebe,"Enter Pheebs."
190,25,5,Joey,"He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he?s not into anything weird sexually."
189,25,4,Phoebe,"Oh."
188,25,3,Joey,"A widower."
187,25,2,Phoebe,"Oh. Ah-uh."
186,25,1,Joey,"Uh, well he?s 33."
185,25,0,Phoebe,"What else? What else?"
184,24,7,Rachel,"I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater."
183,24,6,Ross,"What do you think Rach?"
182,24,5,Ross,"I?ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best."
181,24,4,Ross,"I?ll just have the conversation."
180,24,3,Ross,"I-I?Y?know what?"
179,24,2,Ross,"Forget it."
178,24,1,Chandler,"What are you doing?"
177,24,0,Joey,"So you uh, nervous about getting married?"
176,23,5,Ross,"You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?"
175,23,4,Ross,"I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!"
174,23,3,Ross,"So-so what I am saying is - is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge!"
173,23,2,Ross,"I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash."
172,23,1,"Professor Sherman","Mmm-mm."
